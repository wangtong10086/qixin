# magisk-build-logic

Shared Gradle convention plugins for the Magisk317 Android app family.

Current plugin set:

- `xsc.android.common`
- `relay.android.common`
- `magisk.android.application`
- `magisk.android.common`
- `magisk.android.compose`
- `magisk.android.library`
- `magisk.android.room`
- `magisk.kotlin.library`
- `magisk.app.packaging`
- `magisk.app.signing`
- `magisk.maintenance`

## Consumers

- `XposedSmsCode`
- `xinyi-relay`
- `MiPush`
- `MiPushFramework`

## Build Dependencies

When this repository is included as `build-logic/` inside a consumer project, it
reads the parent project's `gradle/libs.versions.toml` so the convention plugin
classpath follows the consuming app's AGP, Kotlin, KSP, Hilt and Java bytecode
versions.

The consumer catalog is required; this repository does not carry fallback
toolchain or dependency versions.

Because the build reads the consumer catalog, verify plugin changes through a
consumer checkout with this repository mounted at `build-logic/`. The wrapper
under `shared/gradle/` is a synchronization source for consumers, not a
standalone wrapper for this repository.

The plugins themselves still read the target repository's `libs` catalog at
runtime for application-specific versions such as `compileSdk`, `versionName`,
and product flavor behavior.

Android library lint keeps AGP's blocking default. Consumers may suppress
specific, documented checks per module, but the shared convention never turns
off lint failures globally.

### Distribution policy

`xsc.android.common` (XposedSmsCode) and `relay.android.common` (xinyi-relay) own their
product flavor matrices and BuildConfig capability flags. Play and GitHub are the active
distribution flavors for both apps. F-Droid is paused in both conventions: the flavor
blocks stay commented out with explicit resume points, so the two app-level conventions
never drift apart. Pausing a distribution is a documented state (comment + resume point +
this note), never a silent disable — a convention must not create a flavor and then
quietly drop it. Relay dynamic-feature variants remain Play-only because Play Feature
Delivery is a store capability rather than a runtime mode.

`magisk.app.packaging` owns generic APK split, bundle, timestamp, and artifact-name behavior.
Product-specific output constraints stay with the product convention: `xsc.android.common`
and `relay.android.common` own the play/github distribution flavor set (F-Droid paused in
both, resume points in the plugin sources).

Runtime capability states such as Enhanced (Xposed active) and Standard (system APIs) belong
in the consuming application's runtime policy and must not be added here as `full` / `lite`
flavors. A separate binary distribution is justified only by a concrete packaging or
store-compliance requirement, not by the absence of Xposed at runtime.

### Test runtime policy

Applying `magisk.maintenance` to the root project standardizes JUnit Platform execution,
Java 26 native/dynamic-agent flags, worker heap/fork limits, and test logging for every
subproject. Android compile conventions do not mutate test workers.

### Signing contract

`magisk.app.signing` accepts the standard environment variables `KEYSTORE_FILE`,
`STORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS`, and `KEY_PASSWORD`. Relative keystore paths are resolved from
the root project. Local builds may instead use `-Pmagisk.signing.keystore=...` and
`-Pmagisk.signing.properties=...`; defaults are `release.jks`/`app/release.jks` and
`signature.properties`/`app/signature.properties`. Historical Tianma/Yuuta properties and
credential aliases are intentionally unsupported. Every application build type declared by a
consumer uses the shared release signing config; the signing convention does not create
product-specific build types.

## Shared Gradle Assets

This repository also carries a shared Gradle asset bundle under
`shared/gradle/` for wrapper scripts, wrapper metadata, and common
`gradle.properties` defaults.

- `scripts/sync_consumer_gradle_assets.sh <repo...>` syncs one or more consumer
  repositories to the shared wrapper and common properties.
- `scripts/sync_workspace_consumers.sh` syncs the known sibling consumers in the
  local workspace (`xinyi-relay`, `XposedSmsCode`, `push/MiPushFramework`).

The sync is intentionally copy-based. It keeps consumer builds reproducible and
avoids making Gradle startup depend on a moving remote HEAD.

`magisk.maintenance` standardizes test logging and exposes an explicit
`cleanupGradleCaches` task. Normal build, assemble, and clean tasks never delete
Gradle caches as a side effect.

## Usage

Add as a git submodule at `build-logic/` in the consumer repository and keep:

```kotlin
pluginManagement {
    includeBuild("build-logic")
}
```

For `magisk.app.packaging`, consumers can override the artifact base name:

```kotlin
extra["artifactBaseName"] = "MiPushFramework"
```

Release APK names omit distribution flavor labels (`play`, `github` in
xinyi-relay) and preserve product-specific flavor dimensions such as `normal`
or `vc105`. Play App Bundles keep the Android Gradle Plugin output
path and filename; release pipelines should consume the `playRelease` bundle
directly instead of relying on a second renamed copy.
